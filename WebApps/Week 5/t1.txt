Vue componets consist  of 3 diffferent sections, a html template, style (css) and js. Componets is what enables us to seperate the user interface into difference sections allowing us to reuse certain pieces independently. These components accept the same similar data as a new Vue such as methods, computed, data etc. In short a component is a independent and resuable vue instance with an name you set.
