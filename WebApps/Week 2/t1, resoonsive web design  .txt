Responsive web design is an extreamly important thing and all good websites take advantage of it. It is when the website is able to respond to the needs of the user using the website depending of what device they are accessing the website on. For example if 1 user is accessing a website on a pc, the websites layout and demensions will be setup for the perfect viewing and interacting experience for that user. But if another user is accessing the exact same website but on a mobile phone the dimensions and layout of everything will be differernt to help optimising the best viewing and interacting expeince for that user.
